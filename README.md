# MotionSymphony-Plugin-UE4/UE5
Repository for verified users to access source code for the MotionSymphony Plugin in UE4/UE5


UE5 Note: The version for UE4 and UE5 is the same branch. Be aware that UE5 is still in Early Access so while Motion Symphony does appear to be running as intended on UE5, it is not officially supported. Bug fixes for the current version of Unreal Engine take prescedence.
